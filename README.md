# GravMap
GravMap is an interactive web-based tool that visualizes organizational relationships and influence through a physics-based network diagram. Unlike traditional hierarchical org charts, GravMap represents team dynamics as a gravitational system where each person's influence affects others through attractive and repulsive forces.
