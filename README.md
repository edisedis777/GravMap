## Overview

GravMap is an interactive web-based tool that visualizes organizational relationships and influence through a physics-based network diagram. Unlike traditional hierarchical org charts, GravMap represents team dynamics as a gravitational system where each person's influence affects others through attractive and repulsive forces.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Visualization**: Nodes (people) interact through simulated gravitational forces based on influence scores and relationships
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Connect individuals to visualize reporting lines and cross-functional relationships
- **Interactive Interface**: Drag, hover, and explore the network to gain insights about organizational dynamics
- **Real-Time Updates**: Add and remove nodes with immediate visual feedback
- **Influence Gradient**: Visual representation of influence levels through color coding and node size
- **Beautiful UI**: Starry background and glowing node effects create an engaging experience

## How It Works

GravMap uses a custom physics engine to simulate organizational dynamics:

1. **Nodes**: Each person is represented as a node with properties:
   - Name: The individual's name or role
   - Influence: A score from 1-10 representing their organizational impact
   - Relationships: Connections to other nodes

2. **Physics**:
   - All nodes have a slight repulsion force to prevent overlapping
   - Related nodes attract each other, with force proportional to combined influence
   - The most influential node becomes the "central node" that others orbit around
   - Nodes with lower influence tend to orbit those with higher influence

3. **Visual Cues**:
   - Node size represents influence
   - Color gradient from light blue (lower influence) to dark red (higher influence)
   - Connection line thickness indicates relationship strength

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/edisedis777/gravmap.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

That's it! No build process or dependencies to install.

### Usage

1. **Add a Node**: Enter name, influence score (1-10), and select relationships
2. **Remove a Node**: Click the "Ã—" button on the node in the list
3. **Randomize**: Shuffle node positions while maintaining physics rules
4. **Explore**: Hover over nodes to see detailed information
5. **Interact**: Drag nodes to manually position them

## Technical Details

GravMap is built with pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The visualization uses the Canvas API for efficient rendering.

- `script.js`: Core application logic, physics engine, and rendering
- `styles.css`: Visual styling and layout
- `index.html`: Application structure and UI elements

## Inspiration

GravMap was inspired by the article [Gravity Maps: An Alternative to Org Charts](https://www.leadinginproduct.com/p/gravity-maps-an-alternative-to-org-charts) by Janna Bastow. The article describes how traditional org charts fail to capture the complex dynamics of modern organizations and proposes gravity maps as a more nuanced representation.
